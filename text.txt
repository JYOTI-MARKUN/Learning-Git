=======
to check the number of branch in the code git branch
to create a new branch git branch branchname

to  clear the terminal of ctrl + L is not working then use q

to push code from local repo to github git push -u origin branchname
to change the branch name git branch -m main
to pull changes from github to local repo git pull
 about
to merge branches git merge branchname
to delete branch git
to push local repo into github
git push -u origin branchname
to rename a branch git branch -m branchname(you wanted to change to)
to reset commit in the local repo there are three method 
git reset --hard id of the commit where we wanna go (in case of hard reset the head , update the staging area reset the working directory)
git reset --soft id of the commit where we wanna go (in case of soft the head reset , but staging area and current working directory remains unchanges)
git reset --mixed id of the commit where we wanna go (in case of soft the head reset and staging area but current working directory remains unchanges)
if we reset the changes and after that we wanna back those changes then we can use git resert --hard id where we wanna go (but git log will not provide us reset commit id so if we do git reflog that provide us all commit id's )
head represent the current working directly, we can move our head by usiing git checkout head~4 thi will move our code 4 commit behind
we can also so go some particular commit id by git checkout idname

WHEN WE ADD DIFFERENT CODE IN DIFFERENT BARNCH AS THE SAME LINE THEN WHEN WE TRY TO ERGE BRANCHES WE WILL FACE CONFLICT WE NEED TO SOLVE THIS CONFLICT WE NEED TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT CODE WE WANNA SAVE AND THEN ADD IT AND COMMIT IT AND PUSH TO THE ORIGIN 

STASH CHANGES : WHEN WE ARE WORKING ON SOME BRANCH AND SUDDENLY WE NEED TO MOVE TO ANOTHER BRANCH WITH COMMIT AS OUR CODE IS NOT COMPLETED BUT ALSO DO NOT WANT TO LOOSE HALF CODE SO WE HAVE TO STASH CHANGES AND IT WILL STORE IN STASH LIST WE CAN APPLY STACH ONE BY ONE BY 
git stash apply 1
git stash list
git stash drop 1
git stash clear


GWHEB WE HAVE ADDED MANY CODE AND COMMIT IT IN A BRANCH AND IN MAIN BRANCH WE JUST WANNA SOME SPECIFIC COMMIT ONLY THEN WE CAN USE CHERRY-PICK TO CHOOSE ONLY COMMIT WE WANT
git cherry-pick id of the commit

GIT IGNORE file
when we want to ignore some file that we do not want our git to track and show it in github we can put in in .gitignore file 
any file or folder that are added to it will not be tracked by git

but if we add a file and it has been already tracked by git and after that we add it in .gitignore file then git will not ignore it, in this case if we wanna untrack the file he command is 
git rm --cached file name 
for the folder : git rm -- cached -r folderName/
IF YOU DELETD DOME FLE BY ACCIDENT TO RECOVER THAT file
git checkout commit id (one commit before we deleted the actual commit) filename
to add new chnages we need two command first git add. and second git commt -m "" if you want to sive two command and do this in only one command then do this
git commit -am "" 

to open gitconfig file command is 
git config --gloabl -email

to change a branch we can use git checkout branchName and second one is git change branchName

TO CREATE A BRANCH AND GO IN THAT USING ONE COMMAND 
GIT SWITCH -C NEWCREATED BRANCHNAME

 TO REVERT A MERGE commit we need to do command
 git revert idof merge commit -m  (we need to provide -m)
 then we need to tell them we need to get back to the main branch where we are currently sp we meed to do this
 git revert idof merge commit -m 1
